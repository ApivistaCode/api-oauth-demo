# Securing APIs with oAuth2

## Introduction to oAuth2 and OpenID

- oAuth2 standard for managing token access to resources
- OpenId standard for managing user identity

## oAuth2 Flows

### Know the Actors
- Resource Owner: end user
- Client: application requesting access to protected resource
- Resource Server: server with protected resource
- Authorization Server: server that can authorize access to resource server
- User Agent: entity that the end user uses to interact with client, like a browser

### Two flows we will discuss
- Credentials Flow: used when the client owns the resource. ie server to server interactions
- Authorization Code Flow: used when the client is a webapp

### Show the Examples

### The Flows
## Client Credentials flow

-- Discuss jwt, jwks

## Authorization Code Flow

-- Discuss openid vs access token
